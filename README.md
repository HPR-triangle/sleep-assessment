Magic triangle
==============

An alternative tool for patient self-assessment. Intended to help patients reflect on their condition and to prepare for outpatient clinic appointments.

The tool as presented is configured for maxillofacial patients, however the principle should extend to other disciplines (by making appropriate changes to `descriptors.json.js`).

This approach is explored in R.Brown, L.Tomasello, D.A.Mitchell, A.Sebald and S.Stepney. The ternary graph as a questionnaire â€“ a new approach to Quality of Life assessment? <i>British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery</i>, in press (2017).

Currently in use on [maxfacts.uk](http://maxfacts.uk) - a resource on all aspects of oral and maxillofacial surgery for patients, carers and professionals.
